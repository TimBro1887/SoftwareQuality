# Introduction

The "SoftwareQuality" project is a simple Java program that demonstrates the use of the four fundamental math operators in Java. This project serves as an educational resource for those learning Java programming and provides a clear example of how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Java. In addition Junit testing is implemented as well, to gain basic knowlegde on how to do Junit testing.

# Prerequisites

Before you get started with this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. IntelliJ IDEA is used by the creator

# Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the project in your Java development environment (IDE)
3. Run the math.java class and the testmath.java.class

The program will execute, demonstrating the basic math operations and junit testing.

# Math Operators

The following are the four basic math operators covered in this project:

Addition (+): Used to add two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Used to subtract one number from another.
Multiplication (*): Used to multiply two numbers.
